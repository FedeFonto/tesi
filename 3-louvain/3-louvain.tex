\section{Louvain Algorithm}
The Louvain algorithm is a greedy modularity optimization techniques created from a team of researcher from Vincent D. Blondel, Jean-Loup Guillaume, Renaud Lambiotte and Etienne Lefebvre in the 2008 \cite{Blondel_2008}. The algorithm bears the name of the university to which they belong to, i.e. \textit{Universit√© Catholique de Louvain}. This algorithm and its parallel version is the main subject of this thesis. The algorithm is very popular due to his simplicity, efficiency and overall precision.
In this chapter, we present the sequential algorithm in details and some optimization technique presented in the literature.
Then we present the parallel version of the algorithm, focusing on the implementations dedicated to the GPU.
