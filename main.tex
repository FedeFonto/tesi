	\begin{abstract}
		Modularity based algorithms for the detection of communities are the de facto standard thanks to the fact that they offer the best compromise between efficiency and result. 
		This is because these algorithms allow analyzing graphs much larger than those that can be analyzed with alternative techniques. Among these, the Louvain algorithm has become extremely popular due to its simplicity, efficiency and precision.
		In this thesis, we present an overview of community detection techniques and we propose two new parallel implementations of the Louvain algorithm written in CUDA and exploitable by Nvidia GPUs: the first one is based on the sort-reduce paradigm with a pruning approach on the input data; the second one is a new hash-based implementation. Experimental analysis conducted on 13 datasets of different sizes ranging from 15 to 130 million edges shows that the proposed algorithms have different efficiency based on the size of the graph. For this reason, we study also an adaptive solution.
